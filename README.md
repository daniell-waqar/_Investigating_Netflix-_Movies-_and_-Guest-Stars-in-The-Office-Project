# _Investigating_Netflix-_Movies-_and_-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office-Project
In this project, I applied the concepts I learned i."This project was an incredible opportunity to showcase my Python skills and explore real-world data. Through the use of pandas and data visualization techniques, I gained valuable insights into the Netflix movie landscape and the presence of guest stars in "The Office."

HIGHLIGHTS:

1️⃣ Loading my friend's data into a dictionary: I started by collecting data from my friend and organizing it into a dictionary, making it easier to work with and analyze.

2️⃣ Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary: Using the pandas library, I transformed the dictionary into a structured DataFrame, enabling me to manipulate and visualize the data effectively.

3️⃣ Loading the rest of the data from a CSV: I enriched my analysis by incorporating additional data from a CSV file, expanding the scope of my investigation.

4️⃣ Filtering for movies! To focus on movies specifically, I implemented filtering techniques to isolate movie-related data, allowing me to gain insights specifically about Netflix movies.

5️⃣ Creating a scatter plot: I visualized the relationship between movie duration and release year by creating a scatter plot. This revealed an intriguing trend: while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, I discovered that many short movies have been released in the past two decades.

6️⃣ Marking non-feature films: To distinguish non-feature films, I applied markers to the scatter plot. This distinction shed light on the diversity of content available on Netflix beyond traditional feature-length movies.

7️⃣ Plotting with color! To enhance the visual representation, I added color to the scatter plot based on specific movie attributes. This further enriched the analysis and made it easier to identify patterns and correlations.

Overall, this project was an incredible opportunity to showcase my Python skills and explore real-world data. Through the use of pandas and data visualization techniques, I gained valuable insights into the Netflix movie landscape and the presence of guest stars in "The Office."
